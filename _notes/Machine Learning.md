Field of study that gives computers ability to learn without being explictly programmed. It includes [[Linear Regression|Regression]], [[Logistic Regression|Binary Classification]] and [[Softmax Classification|Multi-Label Classification]]. They can be either [[Supervised Learning|Supervised]] or [[Unsupervised Learning|Unsupervised]].

After you design a model, you can optimize the model's problems like [[Overfitting]] by using [[Learning Rate Decay]], [[Normalization]], and [[Regularization]].
