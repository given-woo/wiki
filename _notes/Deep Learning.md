# Deep Learning

Deep Learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on neural networks. It can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

It uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. (While shallow learning use much less layers) For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces. This makes it much more efficient than shallow learning.
