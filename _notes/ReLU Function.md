R(x)=max(0, x)

Relu function is not [[Saturation Problem|satured]] in positive area. It is far faster than [[Sigmoid Function]] or [[Tanh Function]], and it is also considered to be more biologically plausible. But like [[Sigmoid Function]], it is not zero-centered. And [[Saturation Problem]] still happens in negative areas.
