## Impact of Learning Rate

*Fig 1. Different effects of Learning Rate depending on size*

When Learning rate is too high, overshooting can happen. And if Learning Rate is too low, it takes many iterations until convergence and can be trapped in local minima. We can use [[Learning Rate Decay]] to select a appropriate learning rate.
